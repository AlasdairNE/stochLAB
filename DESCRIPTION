Description: Tool for running Collision Risk Models for seabirds on
    offshore wind farms. The base deterministic model is derived from 
    Band (2012) Using a Collision Risk Model to Assess Bird Collision Risks 
    for Offshore Wind Farms. This was further expanded on by 
    Masden (2015) <doi:10.7489/1659-1> and code used here is heavily derived
    from this work with input from Dr A. Cook at the British Trust for
    Ornithology.
